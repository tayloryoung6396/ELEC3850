/**
 * @brief This struct mimics the expected data structure for a Status Return command.
 *
 * @details
 *  This type has it's members arranged in the same way as a raw array of this command would.
 *  Because of this you cannot add or remove members from this type. The template argument and parameter allows you
 *  to write any type. For example if you write with a uint16_t then it will write two bytes to the device. And if
 *  you use a struct with 3 uint16_t's in it, then you directly write to something with an x, y and z byte.
 *
 * @tparam T the type of data to be written
