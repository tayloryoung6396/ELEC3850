/**
 * @brief This struct mimics the expected data structure for a Read command.
 *
 * @details
 *  This type has it's members arranged in the same way as a raw array of this command would. Because of this
 *  you cannot add or remove members from this type. The template argument and parameter allows you to read any
 *  type. For example if you read with a uint16_t then it will read two bytes to the device. And if you use a
 *  struct with 3 uint16_t's in it, then you can directly read a parameter with an x, y and z bytes (e.g. the
 *  accelerometer)
 * @tparam T the type of data to be read
 *
